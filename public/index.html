      Hello you! My code in this tool is not that fun. 
      
      If you want to see how I code, go to my github https://github.com/andreehultgren and you'll find the react source code.

      If you're looking for an easter egg - My favorite game is hidden somewhere in the source code. If you find it, I'll be wayyyyy more interested in joining your company!

      If you're looking for something to hack, then you're out of luck. This site is completely static, so you have nothing to attack except for my github ssh key ;)
